# Survival of patients having hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC)
Hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) survival prediction and clinical factor ranking through computational intelligence

### Dataset
HCC Survival dataset on the University of California Irvine Machine Learning Repository:
[https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/HCC+Survival](https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/HCC+Survival)

### Requirements
R platform

### Execution
To analyze the dataset for survival prediction and for feature ranking, clone/download this GitHub repository, and visit the `/CODE_SUBMISSION` folder. 
For the survival prediction, type:

`Rscript binary_classification_v1a.r`

For the feature ranking, type:

`Rscript feature_ranking_v1b.r`

The program will print the results into files that you will find in the `/RIS/` folder.
